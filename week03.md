## Known Plaintext Attack (KPA):
In a Known Plaintext Attack, the attacker has access to both the plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext. The goal of the attacker is to determine the key used in the encryption process. KPA assumes that the attacker knows some or all of the plaintext-ciphertext pairs generated by the encryption algorithm.Example: Suppose you have a simple encryption algorithm where each letter of the alphabet is shifted by a certain fixed number of positions. If the attacker knows that "HELLO" encrypts to "OLSSV", they can infer the shift used (in this case, a shift of 7) and decrypt other ciphertexts encrypted with the same key.

## Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA):
In a Chosen Plaintext Attack, the attacker can choose plaintexts and obtain their corresponding ciphertexts from the encryption oracle. The goal remains the same as in KPA: to determine the key used in the encryption process. However, in CPA, the attacker can choose any plaintext they want, rather than relying solely on known plaintext-ciphertext pairs.Example: If an attacker can submit plaintexts of their choice to a system and receive the corresponding ciphertexts, they may be able to analyze the patterns in the ciphertexts to deduce information about the encryption algorithm or the key.

## Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA):
In a Chosen Ciphertext Attack, the attacker can choose ciphertexts and obtain their corresponding plaintexts from the decryption oracle. The attacker's goal remains the same: to determine the key used in the encryption process. CCA is more powerful than CPA because the attacker can also manipulate ciphertexts and observe the resulting plaintexts.Example: In a system where the attacker can submit ciphertexts of their choice and receive the corresponding plaintexts, they may be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the decryption process to obtain information about the key.


This is the code we used to encrypted the file/documents-


`openssl rand -hex 8` ( it is used to generate the random key )


`openssl enc -e -des -in test1.txt -out roman1.enc -K 4f9f2c8bc2447d4d -iv 0000000000000000` (this is used to encrpted the file )

Following code is used to decrypt the file/documents-

`openssl enc -d -aes-192-cbc -in output.enc   -out read.txt  -K 4fae528a649099ff -iv 00000000000000`

However, this is a theoretical calculation and does not take into account the actual efficiency and performance of the equipment we have access to. The actual time could be longer or shorter depending on many factors, including the specifics of the vulnerability youâ€™ve discovered and how well it can be exploited with the available equipment.



To perform a speed test using OpenSSL, we can use the speed command.This command will run various cryptographic algorithms and display their performance in terms of operations per second (ops).
